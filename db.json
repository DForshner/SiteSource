Capture event changes in a discrete manner.  Operators (map/filter/reduce) create new streams out of old streams (no mutation).</li>\n<li>Switching - Change the system in response to events.  A stream of streams (meta-stream).  Ex: stream URLs, map to requests, return responses in future stream of promises.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>68-95-99.7 Rule - 68% of values at one standard deviation, 95% at two, and 99.7% of values at three.</li>\n<li>Fit indexes in RAM if possible.  Index on the hash of a string instead of the string itself.</li>\n<li>Use cache as write-back to do batched database writes to the back-end.</li>\n<li>Use locking to make sure that when the cache expires the database doesn’t get slammed with multiple copies of the same query.</li>\n<li>You can decouple a sender and receiver with the command pattern and observer pattern but to decouple them in time you will want to use an event queue.</li>\n<li>Keep data structures flat and linear (array &gt; linked list).  Every pointer you have to chase to find data adds a likely cache miss while flat arrays can be pre-fetched by the memory system.<ul>\n<li>Adding/Removing values from the middle of std::vector is faster than std::list if the elements are POD types and no bigger than 64 bytes (one cache line).  Lists have too many cache misses.</li>\n<li>For larger POD types, non-POD types, or if you already have a pointer into the list then std::list will win.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Odds & Ends - September 2015","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","_content":"Thoughts, terms, and ideas I've come across over the last few months.\n\n* Mobile experiences fill gaps while we wait.
