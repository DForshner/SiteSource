It breaks a confusing field into logical pieces and then shows you how they fit together.  I’d recommend it to anyone who interested in databases or distributed systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does an amazing job of explaining the algorithms and data structures used to implement systems and what problems they are best at solving.</li>\n<li>Focuses on concepts and avoids the mistake of only talking about particular products or implementations.</li>\n<li>Explains different guarantees and the tradeoffs made in providing them.</li>\n<li>Shows how the CAP theorem is misleading when applied to real-world systems.  The author also has a <a href=\"https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html\">Blog Post</a>.  Before this, I thought that quorum style systems with a majority were consistent but it turns out I didn’t even understand what the word consistent means.</li>\n<li>Lots of references and examples.

Overall I think they are on to something.\n\n- It was surprisingly easy to get something up working and then iterate on it.\n- I found the functional concepts they are pushing a refreshing change from messing with jquery.  The code looks actually looks like code instead of a tangled rat's nest of callbacks and dom mutations.\n- It's very explicit about how state is stored and mutated.  People don't think enough about this stuff and haveing it front and center like this is nice.\n- The flux pattern is interesting.  I like how it separates concerns but it seems like there is a lot of code duplication.\n- The idea of updating state and re-rendering reminds me of a game loop.\n- I'm not sure how the virtual DOM is going to perform but the \"native calls are slow\" argument makes sense.  I've run into some bad jank when lots of backbone sub-views get re-rendered at the same time.\n- The jsx concept of combining template(html) and code is a bit strange at first but I think they are on to something.  Using backbone you pretty much end up editing the template/model/view files for most changes so I can see the argument that they aren't independent concerns.\n- I also used Webstorm (support for jsx) for the first time and I never knew what I was missing.

There were two key things they noticed about effective teams:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’ Woolley said. ‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’</p>\n<p>Second, the good teams all had high ‘average social sensitivity’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html\">Link</a></p>\n"},{"title":"What's new in CPUs since the 80s and how does it affect programmers?","date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","_content":"Amazing post about how CPU and memory architecture has changed over the years.\n\n> using predictable memory access patterns and operating on chunks of data that are smaller than your CPU cache will get you most of the benefit of modern caches.\n\n[Post](http://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/)","source":"_posts/What-s-new-in-CPUs-since-the-80s-and-how-does-it-affect-programmers.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"What's new in CPUs since the 80s and how does it affect programmers?\"\ndate: 2015-03-15 00:00:00\ntags:\n  - Optimization\n---\nAmazing post about how CPU and memory architecture has changed over the years.\n\n> using predictable memory access patterns and operating on chunks of data that are smaller than your CPU cache will get you most of the benefit of modern caches.\n\n[Post](http://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/)","slug":"What-s-new-in-CPUs-since-the-80s-and-how-does-it-affect-programmers","published":1,"updated":"2016-03-26T22:12:38.239Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cimmoq1kf002k7skwu8nxjtr0","content":"<p>Amazing post about how CPU and memory architecture has changed over the years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>using predictable memory access patterns and operating on chunks of data that are smaller than your CPU cache will get you most of the benefit of modern caches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Post</a></p>\n","excerpt":"","more":"<p>Amazing post about how CPU and memory architecture has changed over the years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>using predictable memory access patterns and operating on chunks of data that are smaller than your CPU cache will get you most of the benefit of modern caches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/\">Post</a></p>\n"},{"title":"Working Effectively with Legacy Code","date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","_content":"- Shows you how to bring existing code under test so you can safely make changes to it.\n- Most books present a kind of clean room/fait accompli image of testing.
