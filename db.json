This book appears to be aimed at people working with a traditional n-tier architecture with a shared database who are having problems scaling both their application and organization.  The author gives a high-level overview of microservices and the patterns used but this book is about organizational change.\n\nAfter reading this, I don't think microservices are a good fit for the products I work on.  I've been associating microservices with things like automated deployment, centralized logging and performance monitoring, etc. but these are actually prerequisites to get into microservices.  I don't think the additional complexity that a microservices architecture brings are going to be worth it in my case.\n\n[Good Reads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices?utm_medium=api&utm_source=blog_book)\n\n**Chapter Notes**\n1. *Microservices*\n * If shared libraries are specific to a business domain or talk to particular services they can limit the ability to independently scale and deploy different parts of the system.\n2. *The Evolutionary Architect*\n  * Helping people grow so they can understand the overall technical vision and can be active participants in shaping and implementing it.\n  * Great software comes from great people. If you worry only about the technology side of the equation, you're missing the picture.\n3. *How to Model Services*\n  * By aligning services to the seams between bounded contexts we ensure the services are built around relatively stable boundaries.\n4. *Integration*\n  * Expand Only Types - Types sent over the wire using binary serialization can become a mass of fields, some of which are no longer used but can't be removed safely.\n  * Don't violate DRY within a microservice, but be relaxed about violating DRY across services.  The evils of too much coupling between services are far worse than the problems caused by code duplication.\n  * The Strangler Pattern - Capture and intercept calls to the old system and either route these calls the existing or new code.  This allows you to replace functionality over time instead of doing a re-write.\n  * Database integration makes it very hard to avoid breaking changes.  Prefer REST because changes to internal implementation detail are less likely to result in a change to the service interface.\n  * Tolerant Reader - A reader able to ignore changes we don't care about.\n  * Semantic Versioning - Outlines the expectations of clients can have of changes to the API and simplifies the process of communicating about whether changes should impact consumers.\n5. *Splitting the Monolith*\n  * Bounded contexts make great seams because they represent cohesive  units that are the loosely coupled boundaries in an organization.\n6. *Deployment*\n  * Focus on the ability to release each service independently of each other.\n  * One source control repository, one CI build, and one host/container per service.\n  * Culture of automation is key to managing everything.\n7. *Testing*\n  * Service Test - Test a slice of functionality across the whole service but isolate yourself from other services by using stubbed collaborators.\n  * Normalization of deviance - Over time we become accustomed to things being wrong and we start to accept that as being normal and not a problem.  Ex: flakey tests, alarms that should be warnings, etc.\n  * Anything that causes multiple service versions to be deployed in a specific order will eventually destroy the ability to deploy one service by itself.\n  * Focus on a small number of core journeys to test for the whole system when developing end-to-end tests.\n  * Consumer-Driven Tests - Capture the expectations of how a consumer will use a service in tests to make sure that when new versions of the service go to production it won't break consumers.\n  * Smoke tests - Set of tests designed to run against newly deployed software to confirm the deployment worked.\n  * Blue/Green Deployment - Have two copies of software deployed at the same time, but only one version if receiving real requests.  Allows you to switch back quickly if something goes wrong.\n  * Canary Releasing - Verify a deployment by directing small amounts of production traffic against to see if it performs as expected.  Can send either divert a portion of real traffic or can shadow production traffic and direct it to the canary.\n  * Optimizing mean time between failures (MTBF) vs. mean time to repair (MTTR) - Expending the same effort into getting better at remediation of a release can be more beneficial than adding more automated tests.\n8. *Monitoring*\n  * Service metrics - Generate service specific events for monitoring.

If you worry only about the technology side of the equation, you're missing the picture.\n3. *How to Model Services*\n  * By aligning services to the seams between bounded contexts we ensure the services are built around relatively stable boundaries.\n4. *Integration*\n  * Expand Only Types - Types sent over the wire using binary serialization can become a mass of fields, some of which are no longer used but can't be removed safely.\n  * Don't violate DRY within a microservice, but be relaxed about violating DRY across services.  The evils of too much coupling between services are far worse than the problems caused by code duplication.\n  * The Strangler Pattern - Capture and intercept calls to the old system and either route these calls the existing or new code.  This allows you to replace functionality over time instead of doing a re-write.\n  * Database integration makes it very hard to avoid breaking changes.  Prefer REST because changes to internal implementation detail are less likely to result in a change to the service interface.\n  * Tolerant Reader - A reader able to ignore changes we don't care about.\n  * Semantic Versioning - Outlines the expectations of clients can have of changes to the API and simplifies the process of communicating about whether changes should impact consumers.\n5. *Splitting the Monolith*\n  * Bounded contexts make great seams because they represent cohesive  units that are the loosely coupled boundaries in an organization.\n6. *Deployment*\n  * Focus on the ability to release each service independently of each other.\n  * One source control repository, one CI build, and one host/container per service.\n  * Culture of automation is key to managing everything.\n7. *Testing*\n  * Service Test - Test a slice of functionality across the whole service but isolate yourself from other services by using stubbed collaborators.\n  * Normalization of deviance - Over time we become accustomed to things being wrong and we start to accept that as being normal and not a problem.  Ex: flakey tests, alarms that should be warnings, etc.\n  * Anything that causes multiple service versions to be deployed in a specific order will eventually destroy the ability to deploy one service by itself.\n  * Focus on a small number of core journeys to test for the whole system when developing end-to-end tests.\n  * Consumer-Driven Tests - Capture the expectations of how a consumer will use a service in tests to make sure that when new versions of the service go to production it won't break consumers.\n  * Smoke tests - Set of tests designed to run against newly deployed software to confirm the deployment worked.\n  * Blue/Green Deployment - Have two copies of software deployed at the same time, but only one version if receiving real requests.  Allows you to switch back quickly if something goes wrong.\n  * Canary Releasing - Verify a deployment by directing small amounts of production traffic against to see if it performs as expected.  Can send either divert a portion of real traffic or can shadow production traffic and direct it to the canary.\n  * Optimizing mean time between failures (MTBF) vs. mean time to repair (MTTR) - Expending the same effort into getting better at remediation of a release can be more beneficial than adding more automated tests.\n8. *Monitoring*\n  * Service metrics - Generate service specific events for monitoring.

There is not such thing as **magic scaling sauce** (a generic one-size-fits-all scalable architecture).\n2. *The Battle of the Data Models*\n  * <u>Many to one relationships</u> - Prefer relational model\n  * <u>One to many (hierarchy) relationships</u> - Prefer document model\n  * <u>Many to many relationships</u> - Prefer graph model\n  * The advantage of using and ID is that it has no reason to change even in the information it identifies changes.\n  * Document databases don't need joins to work with one-to-many tree structures, and support for joins if often weak.\n3. *Storage and Retrieval*\n  * Storage engines fall into two broad categories:\n    * <u>Transaction processing systems</u> - Many queries each accessing a small number of records using some kind of key.  Disk seek time is often the bottleneck.\n    * <u>Analytic system</u> - Few queries each accessing a large number of records.  Disk bandwidth is often the bottleneck.  Column databases work best for computing aggregated statistics.\n   * Two major implementations of storage engines are:\n    * <u>log-structured</u> - Only ever appends to files (Cassandra).\n    * <u>update-in-place</u> - Treat disk as fixed size pages that can be overwritten (Traditional RDMS/B-Trees).\n   * The performance of in-memory databases is more because they avoid the overhead of encoding the data into data structures that can be written to disk than the actual reading from disk.\n   * Easier to maintain sorted order in memory with Red-Black/AVL trees which allow keys to be inserted in any order and read back in sorted order.\n   * The star schema divides data into facts and dimensions.  Each row in a <u>fact table</u> represents and event that occurred at a particular time.  Each row in a <u>dimension table</u> represents the who, what, where, when, how, and why of the event.  Visually the fact table is in the middle, surrounded by its foreign keys to dimension tables like rays of a star.\n   * The key idea of log-structured storage engines is to turn random-access writes into sequential writes on disk which are faster on HDD/SSD.\n   * When queries involve sequentially scanning across a large number of rows, indexes are much less relevant.  Instead, it becomes important to encode data compactly, to minimize the amount of data the query needs to read from disk.\n4. *Encoding and Evolution*\n  * Data flow:\n    * <u>Databases</u> - Different applications read/write to a shared database.\n    * <u>REST/RPC</u> - Clients connect to a server that exposes API (service).  The server may talk to other servers to handle client request (microservices).\n    * <u>Message Passing</u> - Asynchronous message passing systems (Message brokers or distributed actors) where nodes send each other messages.\n  * During rolling upgrades different nodes will be running different versions of code so we need the data flowing in the system to have both backward compatibility and forward compatibility.\n5. *Replication*\n  * Reasons to replicate:\n    * Keep working even when machines go down (availability)\n    * Continue to work during network partitions (availability)\n    * Place data geographically close to users (latency)\n    * Handle higher volume of writes than possible with one machine (scalability).\n  * Replication types:\n    * <u>Single-leader</u> - Clients sent all writes to single leader node which streams changes to followers.  Can read from any node but followers may be stale.\n    * <u>Multi-leader</u> - Clients send each write to one of several leader nodes.  Leaders send streams of changes to each other and followers.   Need to handle write concurrency conflicts.\n    * <u>Leaderless replication</u> - Clients read and write to/from several nodes in parallel.   Need to handle write concurrency conflicts.\n  * Consistency models:\n    * <u>Read-after-write</u> - User should see the latest copy of any data they submitted themselves.\n    * <u>Monotonic reads</u> - After user sees data from one point in time they should never see data from an earlier point in time.\n    * <u>Consistent prefix reads</u> - Users see data in casual order.  Should not see the answer before the question.\n6. *Partitioning*\n  * Partitioning Strategies:\n    * <u>Key</u> Range - assign a continuous range of keys.  Allows efficient range queries but increases the risk of hot spots.\n    * <u>Hash</u> - assign based on the hash of the key.  Uniformly distribute skewed data preventing hot spots but inefficient range queries.\n    * <u>Compound Key</u> -  Hybrid approach. The first part of the key is hashed to determine partition and the second part is used to sort the data within the partition.  Allows efficient range queries on the columns in the second part of the key.\n7. *Transactions*\n  * An abstraction layer that allows applications to pretend certain types of concurrency problems and faults don't exist.\n8. *The Trouble with Distributed Systems*\n  * Typical partial failures include:\n    * Both the sent packet and its reply can be lost or delayed.\n    * Node clocks being out of sync with each other.\n    * Clocks jumping forward or back in time due to NTP.\n    * Processes pausing for long periods and not realizing they have been paused when resumed.\n  * To tolerate faults you first need to detect them and the only tool we have is timeouts which tell us nothing about the nature of the fault.\n9. *Consistency and Consensus*\n  * Shows how the CAP theorem is misleading when applied to real-world systems.  The author also has a [Blog Post](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html).

Move bits when no one is watching\n    * Send contact list while signing in.\n    * Start uploading files while the user is filling out the details.\n    * Send data as soon as part of it is ready to go and match it up on the server later.\n* Code reviews are like having a shared brain.\n* Shed load on social media sites by having shorter feeds.\n* Achieve loose coupling using notifications, events, signals, etc.\n* **Project scaling**\n  * Code standards so everything looks the same\n  * Unit tests and design documents so it's easy to switch implementations and modify.\n  * All you need a work priority queue with ideas and bugs.\n  * Be transparent.\n  * Don't be date focused!  It's too idealistic.\n  * Have short cycles, quick deliverables, and frequent estimates and re-estimates.\n* **Web crawling techniques**\n  1. Start at seed page and recursively follow all/subset of links.\n  2. Identify a pattern in the URL for pages you want.  Ex: resource/id/ and check every valid id in range.\n  3.

Most books present a kind of clean room/fait accompli image of testing.  This book shows you how to crawl through the trenches struggling for some small incremental victory against the hordes of complexity and bit rot that surround your position.  I guess what I'm trying to say is you should buy this book.\n\n[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code?utm_medium=api&utm_source=blog_book)\n\n**Chapter Notes**\n* *Forward*\n  * Requirements change.  Designs that cannot tolerate changing requirements are poor designs.\n  * Turn systems that gradually degrade into systems that gradually improve.\n* *Preface*\n  * With tests we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably.  Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better for worse.\n  * Don't be alarmed if some of the steps you take to cut out areas to start growing good code look ugly.  This is surgery.\n1. *Changing Software*\n  * Behavior is the most important thing about software.  It is what users depend on.\n  * Programmers don't attempt to improve a design because it is easy to lose behavior or create bad behavior in the process of doing it.\n  * Make a series of small structural modifications, supported by tests to make the code easier to change.\n2. *Working with Feeback*\n  * Changes in a system can be made in two primary ways: Edit and Pray or Cover and Modify.\n  * Software Vise - The behavior or the code is fixed in place.  When we make changes, we can know that we are changing only one piece of behavior at a time.\n  * Good tests are fast and allow you to localized problems quickly.\n3. *Sensing and Separation*\n4. *The Seam Model*\n  * How often are small pieces reused independently?  Not very often.  Reuse is tough.\n  * Seam - A place in the program where you alter behavior without editing that place.\n5. *Tools*\n6. *I Don't Have Much Time and I Have to Change It*\n  * Navigating through code that contains decorators that decorate other decorators is a lot like peeling away the layers of an onion.  It is necessary work, but it does make your eyes water.\n7. *It Takes Forever to Make a Change*\n  * Interfaces typically change far less than the code that implements them.

Designs that cannot tolerate changing requirements are poor designs.\n  * Turn systems that gradually degrade into systems that gradually improve.\n* *Preface*\n  * With tests we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably.  Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better for worse.\n  * Don't be alarmed if some of the steps you take to cut out areas to start growing good code look ugly.  This is surgery.\n1. *Changing Software*\n  * Behavior is the most important thing about software.  It is what users depend on.\n  * Programmers don't attempt to improve a design because it is easy to lose behavior or create bad behavior in the process of doing it.\n  * Make a series of small structural modifications, supported by tests to make the code easier to change.\n2. *Working with Feeback*\n  * Changes in a system can be made in two primary ways: Edit and Pray or Cover and Modify.\n  * Software Vise - The behavior or the code is fixed in place.  When we make changes, we can know that we are changing only one piece of behavior at a time.\n  * Good tests are fast and allow you to localized problems quickly.\n3. *Sensing and Separation*\n4. *The Seam Model*\n  * How often are small pieces reused independently?  Not very often.  Reuse is tough.\n  * Seam - A place in the program where you alter behavior without editing that place.\n5. *Tools*\n6. *I Don't Have Much Time and I Have to Change It*\n  * Navigating through code that contains decorators that decorate other decorators is a lot like peeling away the layers of an onion.  It is necessary work, but it does make your eyes water.\n7. *It Takes Forever to Make a Change*\n  * Interfaces typically change far less than the code that implements them.  It's better to depend on interfaces or abstract classes than on volatile concrete classes.\n8. *How Do I Add a Feature*\n  * Normalized Hierarchy - No class has more than one implementation of a method.
