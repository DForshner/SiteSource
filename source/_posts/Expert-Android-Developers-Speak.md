Presentations on Kotlin and using JNI for android development.
- I really like Kotlin's idea of separating nullable and non-nullable references.  It seems similar to the option/maybe monad idea (apologies if you design type systems and languages).
- The gist of the JNI presentation seemed to be that you really don't want to use and the extra layers will probably make your code slower.  It's a way of using C/C++ libraries and not a way to increase performance.
