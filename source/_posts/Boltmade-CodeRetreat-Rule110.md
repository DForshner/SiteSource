Attended my first [boltmade](https://www.boltmade.com/) code retreat.  The basic idea is to pair program with another attendee to try and implement Rule 110 in 30 min rounds.  The catch is that each round you start over with a different partner, variation of the problem, and possibly programming language.

I was a bit nervous but it was a surprisingly fun time.  I had some ideas I didn't get to try so I ended up doing [my own version](https://github.com/DForshner/CSharpExperiments/blob/master/Rule110CellularAutomaton.cs) the next day.
