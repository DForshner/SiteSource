The Bloom filter and Count-Min Sketch data structures keep cropping while I'm reading so I figured I would try to implement them.  They are both part of a family of probabilistic data structures that give up accuracy to store a lot of information in a tiny amount of space.

[Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) - Could I have seen this before?
[Countâ€“Min Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count%E2%80%93min_sketch) - What's the maximum number of times I could have seen this?

It's also worth looking at:
[HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) - Approximately how many unique elements have I seen?
