I gave a presentation on doing effective code reviews at my company's internal developer summit.  There were a *few* more people than I was expecting.  I'm told I didn't look nervous which I'm guessing was due to the dark lighting â˜º.

Having worked on both teams that do code reviews and those that do not I'm convinced that they make a real difference.  They are even more important when people are new to a team (or to software development).  I'd put code reviews right up there with source control on the **must do** development practices list.
