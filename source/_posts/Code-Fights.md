Looking for some fun puzzles?  Practicing for a horribly broken interview process?  Tired of the smell of whiteboard markers?

Why not check out Code Fights?

They had me at C# support and a vim mode in the editor, but the arcade mode is actually really fun.  I've messed around a few different online coding challenge websites, and this is the best one I've seen yet.
