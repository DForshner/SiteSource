- Shows you how to bring existing code under test so you can safely make changes to it.
- Most books present a kind of clean room/fait accompli image of testing.  This book shows you how to crawl through the trenches struggling for some small incremental victory against the hordes of complexity and bit rot that surround your position.
- Probably the most interesting book on refactoring and software testing I've ever read.
