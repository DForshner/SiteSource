Notes from a webinar by Matt Sherman, Engineering Manager at Stack Overflow, on the companyâ€™s technical interview process.

Key Traits to look for: Smart and gets things done.

General principals
  * Not a quiz! No gotchas! No brain teasers!
  * You want to start a conversation that reveals how they think.
  * Choose problems that lead to good conversations!
  * Do you want to work with this person?
  * Each interviewer must decide hire/no hire (no maybes)
    * "I think they are a good but not right for my team" is a red flag.
  * Interviewees (even no hires) should leave feeling they are respected!  
    * They may be future customers.  
    * They may have friends you may want to interview.
  * Schedule 60 min but say 45 min so you can end early if they are struggling.  Be graceful about ending early.
  * Look for depth, passion, interest in the product.  It's hard to look for a "cultural fit".
  * Document technical questions and try to standardize interviews.
  * Ask yourself: At the end of 60 min what information do I want to have about this person?
  * Evaluate your own performance during interviews.  What could you have done better?
  * It's better to not hire than accidently hire a bad candidate.  Err on the side of no hire.
  * Shadowing - Follow experienced interviewer for 6 months.  Do mock interviews with co-workers.
  * Interview cycle should take 2-3 weeks max.
   * Feedback 
    * "You're not there yet but we think you could be."
    * Provide list of books to read and things to work on
    * NOTHING PERSONAL! (Legal Issues) 
	
Interview process
* Step 1 - Resume Review
  * [T]argeted - Is this a targeted application or a generic mass mailing?  Why do they want to work here?
  * [E]experienced - 4+ yrs. full stack
  * [D]epth - Tech is a stack of layers.  They use the software but they also know how to go deeper into guts of the system.
  * [P]assion - Do they enjoy programming?  Do they make games?  Code for fun?
  * [G]ets Things Done - Do they get things out the door?  Do they finish projects/products?
* Step 2 - Remote Code Screen
  * 30 min over hangouts using a shared document.
  * Should be intentionally easy.  
  * Any day to day programmer should be able to do it.
* Step 3 - Smart interview
  * In-depth algorithm question
  * How much complexity can they keep in their head at once time?
  * Encourage them to think out loud.  It's a conversation.
  * Make it clear you want to know their thought process, not the answer.  It's fine if they get it wrong and go back.
* Step 4 - Gets things done interview
  * A larger system design question.
  * At an architectural/high-level design an entire application.
  * Look at a system and understand what each part is and how they work together.
  * DB (SQL) + Web Server (C#/Ruby/etc.) + Browser (JS/HTML)
  * Look for both breadth and macro understanding.
  * Full-stack - They could do the whole thing on their own.
* Step 5 - Product management interview
  * Talk to the people who decide what the products are.
  * Do they understand users and the business?
  * Do they care about customers?
  * How would you design and test this product?
  * How would you know if this product was successful?
  * A lot of engineers do product management at some point.
* Step 6 - Executive interviews
  * It's your turn to sell yourself and convince them they want to work here.
  * They probably have other offers.
  * Start talking about a team they might fit on.
* Step 7 - Make an offer  
  * Important to have a fast turnaround.

Finding candidates
* Have a good brand
  * Recruiters are your brand! 
  * Go to events/meetups.
  * Connect with people.
* It's much easier to develop a brand if it's true :-)
* The ideal situation is when an engineer already working at company recommends another engineer.
