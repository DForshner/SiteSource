The session centered on using the  [card sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_sorting) to develop intuitive layouts.  For example, developing a website navigation structure that is obvious to users.  Card sorting is considered a brainstorming step, so it's important that users focus on grouping into categories and not on designing the site.

Card sorting comprises grouping cards that describe features and content into groups.  The number of cards ranges from 30 Cards for a general user to 60 cards for a domain expert.  Users should aim for 5+ groupings.

In the first half, we got into groups and did an open card sort in groups of 2-4 people.  In an open card sort, users generate their own categories when grouping the cards.  It's a generative tool used to discover the categories and vocabulary that users use.

The discussions that occur while a group is doing the sort are a valuable source for information you won't get from an individual card sort.  Disagreements can be a good thing that allows the best ideas to rise to the top but you want to be careful to prevent an individual group member from dominating the conversation.

In the second half, we did a closed card sort as individuals using [optimal workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/).  Closed card sorts have pre-defined categories and are best for validating your design. 

The presenter pointed out that prototypes are the best way of validating that users can find stuff.  They use card sorting to help develop a prototype and then use the prototype to do their validation.  As an example, they showed a series of paper screen mock-ups they asked users to navigate while performing different tasks.
