I made a little proof of concept demo comparing an object orientated to a data orientated entity component system for fun.

I poked around with a C++ port of [Artimis](http://piemaster.net/2011/07/entity-component-artemis/) (a data-oriented game engine) for [PostApocalypticFarming](https://github.com/DForshner/PostApocalypticFarming) but that never to the point of doing anything interesting.
