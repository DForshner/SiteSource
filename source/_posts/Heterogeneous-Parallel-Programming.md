- About two weeks in I realized I had bitten off more than I could chew.  I passed (with distinction even) but I burned way more hours on this than I had budgeted for.  The course says 6-8hr/week but I was easily doubling that.  I really should have brushed up on my C and explored CUDA on my own first.
- Changed how I look at processors and memory and I'm not sure that I'm better off after seeing how the sausage is made.  It's amazing computers work half as well as they do.
