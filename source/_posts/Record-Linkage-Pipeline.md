I've been working away on a coding challenge to match records from two different data sources, and I think I'm close to being done.  I haven't done much work involving processing text documents, so it's been a learning experience.  Given more time I'd like to look into classifying listings based on their sentence structure, but the weather is getting nice enough that I'm going to have put side projects on the back burner for a bit â˜º.
