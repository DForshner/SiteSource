I attended the Google I/O Extended conference at Google's KW location.  The main theme this year seemed to be about getting the rest of the world online.

*Event Notes*
* Currently there are 2.6 billion people on the internet, but there will be 5 billion in the future.
* Free and open information access can lead to regime change.
* +4% GDP due to internet access.
* It's not just search.  We have to drive the information by making it relevant and fun.
* Information access -> open communication -> drives change by allowing silent groups to have a voice.
* ~300 people at the KW office.
* Most effective ad length on YouTube is 12 seconds maximum.
* google.com/design - Unified design guidelines that are driven by material design.
* Minimize interactions with the device by showing relevant data first.  Use sensors to understand the user's current context.
* Maps Features: Fast, Accurate, Easy
* One Android SDK for all platforms: TV, phone, car, watch, etc.
* Chromebook Features: Speed, Simplicity, Security
* Google Drive encrypts your data in both during transit and storage.
* **Google cloud**
  * Allows small teams to run big operations.
  * Cloud.Debug allows live debugging on servers
  * Request tracing to see all service requests
  * Can set custom alerts on metrics
* **Cloud DataFlow**
  * Same code for both batch and streaming

  * Material Metaphor: Shared experience, Shared knowledge, back story for design, pre-defined information.
  * Ex: Paper has a long history, exists in the world, is tangible.
  * Magical Material - Not for the sake of artifice but for information.  Ex: on touch the surface rises to the finger.
  * One typeface with various sizes and weights.
  * Use a color hierarchy to focus the gaze.
  * Material lives at the same scale as the device and expands to fill space.
  * Obey physics so no teleporting.
