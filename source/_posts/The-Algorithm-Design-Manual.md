Two books in one!
* A guide on how to approach solving problems.
* An Encyclopedia of algorithms and data structures.

If you want a sense of 'what's out there' in the world of algorithms and data structures then this is the book for you.  It doesn't go deep into any one topic but it does give you a sense of what problems a given algorithm might solve and some of the trade-offs to consider when applying it.

Have a few minutes to burn? Just go to a random page and I guarantee you will learn something new.
