I'm enrolled at the University of Calgary in an electrical engineering post graduate diploma program with the eventual goal of switching into the biomedical engineering masters program.

So far I'm taking:
* BMEN601 Fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering - an overview of the biomedical engineering field with focus on presenting and writing research papers.
* ENEL563 Biomedical Signal Analysis - looks at the characteristics of different biomedical signals and how to use FIR filters and statistical analysis in Matlab to isolate and identify features of interest.
* NANS301 Introduction to Nanoscience and Nanotechnology - An introductory course on nanoscience, nanotechnology, and nanomaterials.
