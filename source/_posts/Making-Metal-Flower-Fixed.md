I fixed the finish by heating the piece to 250-300F before applying additional coats and using a blow torch to touch up a few missed spots.  

Unfortunately, I managed to snap off a leaf and the blossom and then proceeded to reattach them slightly off center.  Note to self: don't grind away the entire weld.
