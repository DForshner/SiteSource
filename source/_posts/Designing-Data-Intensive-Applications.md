This book is still in pre-release and I've enjoyed the first nine chapters.  It breaks a confusing field into logical pieces and then shows you how they fit together.  I'd recommend it to anyone who interested in databases or distributed systems.

- Does an amazing job of explaining the algorithms and data structures used to implement systems and what problems they are best at solving.
- Focuses on concepts and avoids the mistake of only talking about particular products or implementations.
- Explains different guarantees and the tradeoffs made in providing them.
- Shows how the CAP theorem is misleading when applied to real-world systems.  The author also has a [Blog Post](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html).  Before this, I thought that quorum style systems with a majority were consistent but it turns out I didn't even understand what the word consistent means.
- Lots of references and examples.  The author has pulled together a lot of material for this book.
