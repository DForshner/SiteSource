Thoughts, terms, and ideas I've come across over the last few months.

* Pretend you had to create a schedule before you knew the requirements or you need to estimate how long it will take to solve an unsolved problem.
  * When you don't know what you are going to build then you cannot know how long it will take to build it.
  * You only know for sure what you are going to build when you finish it.
  * A good way to document requirements is to create a user manual.
* Agile - build a little, test a little.
* Good tech leads shield engineers from distractions and give support when needed.  Enable people to do their jobs.
