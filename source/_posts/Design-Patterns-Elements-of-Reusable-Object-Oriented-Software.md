- Most of the patterns revolve around solving problems in the GUI domain using a static language.
- This strikes me as one of those books everyone says to read but havent' read themselves.
- It's ... rather dry.  Useful if you have insomnia.
- I'd recommend [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=blog_book) instead.
