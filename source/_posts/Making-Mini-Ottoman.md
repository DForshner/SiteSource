I have finished the mini-ottoman/footstool that I have been working on the last few weeks.  The frame is steel 1" square tube and 3/4" angle that I spent way too much time grinding.

I am pretty happy with how it turned out.  I wish I had taken more pictures of the welding process, but such is life.
